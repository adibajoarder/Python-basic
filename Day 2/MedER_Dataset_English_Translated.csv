"Serum osmolality that increases or decreases by as much as 1 percent can cause a distinct decrease or increase in vasopressin secretion. The immediate effect of an increase in serum osmolality—for example, if a person becomes dehydrated (i.e., loses water through excessive sweating)—is a stimulation of osmoreceptors. This stimulation leads to the dissociation of vasopressin from the neurophysin molecule, where vasopressin is loosely bound within the secretory cell.",Vasopressin,Brain,Dehydration,Vasopressin,Peptide hormones,Dehydrated
"Vasopressin is then released from the pituitary gland, which then retains water in the kidneys. Conversely, the immediate effect of a decrease in serum osmolality—for example, if a person becomes overhydrated (i.e., drinks too much water)—is inhibition of osmoreceptors. This inhibition leads to a decrease in vasopressin secretion and a subsequent increase in water excretion. Osmoreceptors are also closely linked to the thirst center, which is stimulated by high serum osmolality and inhibited by low serum osmolality, similar to vasopressin secretion.",Vasopressin,"Pituitary gland, kidneys",Diabetes insipidus,Vasopressin,Peptide hormones," Osmolality, osmoreceptors, serum"
"In the kidneys, vasopressin acts on the cells of the collecting ducts. These cells have receptors for vasopressin that are associated with vesicles that contain special water channels (aquaporins). When the cells are stimulated by vasopressin, the aquaporins bind to regions of the cell membrane that are in contact with urine, allowing water to enter the cells. The water then returns to the circulation. This reduces the volume of urine and increases the amount of sodium, chloride, and other substances in the urine. When this happens, the urine is said to be concentrated.",Vasopressin,Kidney,Kidney problems and water balance problems,Vasopressin,Peptide hormones,Aquaporin
" Vasopressin is also released in response to decreased blood volume.

Calcitonin is a hormone that plays a role in regulating the level of calcium in your blood. The C-cells in your thyroid gland produce calcitonin. There do not appear to be any direct negative side effects from having abnormal levels of calcitonin in your body.,Calcitonin,Thyroid gland,,Calcitonin,Peptide hormones,Side effects

"Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located under your skin in the front of your neck. It is part of your endocrine system and controls many important functions in your body by producing and secreting (secreting) certain hormones. The C-cells (parafollicular cells) in your thyroid produce and secrete calcitonin.",Calcitonin,Thyroid,Hypercalcemia,Calcitonin,Peptide hormones,Hormones
"In the past, healthcare providers prescribed synthetic (manufactured) forms of calcitonin as medications to treat Paget's disease of bone, hypercalcemia, and osteoporosis.

"Calcitonin inhibits (blocks) the activity of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone. When osteoclasts break down your bones, calcium is released from your bones into your bloodstream.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a hormone that your parathyroid glands make and release to help regulate the level of calcium in your blood by increasing it. PTH also helps regulate the levels of phosphorus (a mineral) and vitamin D (a hormone) in your blood and bones. There are four pea-sized parathyroid glands behind your thyroid gland.,Parathyroid,Parathyroid glands,Hyperparathyroidism,Parathyroid,Peptide hormones,Vitamins
"Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium levels, while calcitonin decreases blood calcium levels. However, parathyroid hormone appears to have a more important role in regulating your blood calcium levels than calcitonin. Scientists know this mainly because high or low levels of parathyroid hormone can cause hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) or hypocalcemia (low blood calcium levels), respectively, which can be serious conditions. On the other hand, high or low levels of calcitonin don't have much effect on your body.","Parathyroid hormone, calcitonin","Parathyroid gland, thyroid gland","Hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia","Parathyroid, calcitonin",Peptide hormones,Calcium levels

"Having high levels of calcitonin can be a sign of a rare condition, including: Medullary thyroid cancer: This is a rare thyroid cancer that arises in the C-cells of your thyroid gland — the cells that make calcitonin. Because of this, medullary thyroid cancer can cause those cells to produce excessive amounts of calcitonin. Although the excess calcitonin does not affect your body, MTC can and often does spread to other tissues (metastasize), especially to the lymph nodes.",Calcitonin,Thyroid gland,Medullary thyroid cancer,Calcitonin,Peptide hormones,Cancer
"Higher-than-normal levels of calcitonin do not appear to negatively affect your body or cause symptoms. However, having high levels of calcitonin can be a sign of one of several rare conditions, including: C-cell hyperplasia: This is a benign (noncancerous) condition that causes an abnormal growth of C-cells in your thyroid. The enlarged tissue can release excess calcitonin. C-cell hyperplasia can sometimes develop into medullary thyroid cancer.",Calcitonin,Thyroid,"C-cell hyperplasia, medullary thyroid cancer",Calcitonin,Peptide hormones,Thyroid cancer
"High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate via the renal tubules, leading to marked hypocalcemia. However, this is a secondary effect that has no physiological significance in humans.
